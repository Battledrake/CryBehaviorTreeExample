A small project to show how to code up a behavior tree

After project is downloaded, right click on Game.cryproject and generate solution. In order to make use of the Decorator Node(and possibly others with children), the project has to be run in profile. This is just for the behavior tree editor. A crash occurs when setting the child through the editor in Debug mode. Can create manually through xml, or load the xml in debug mode just fine.

SideNote: All behavior trees must be saved to the scripts>AI>BehaviorTrees folder.
